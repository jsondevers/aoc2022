# Advent of Code 2022

## Participated in the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/about) Event for December 2022

### This was my first time partipating in AoC and it was really enlightening to see many different solutions in various languages. I wanted to improve my all around programming skills in certain languages. Throughout these daily challenges, I used a randomizer to select what language I would use for a certain day's problem. Towards the end of the challenge, I sometimes had to reference solutions. 

#### The following languages were possible options:

- Python
- Java
- C++
- Rust
- C#
- Go

### File System Example

```bash
aoc2022
    |- README.md
    |-language_choice.cpp
    |-day1
    |    |-solution.<extension>
    |    |-input.txt
    |    |-prompt.txt
    |    |-example.txt
```
